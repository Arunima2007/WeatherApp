# WeatherApp

This is a basic weather app I created to learn how to fetch APIs and manipulate the data received from them.

The project uses:
- HTML for structure
- Vanilla CSS for styling
- Vanilla JavaScript, including modern features like Fetch API, async/await, and basic DOM manipulation

It helped me understand asynchronous data handling and how to build responsive front-end applications using JavaScript.
